THE SHOW

LOGLINE: 

After she is dumped by her partner, a queer, anti-social Black woman is takes in a quirky roommate, which forces her to confront the lack of purpose, love and connection in her life.

SYNOPSIS: 

When she is dumped, Novelette struggles to pay the rent so she takes in a roommate Audre, who could not be more different from her. She tries to adjust to Audre’s boldness, independence and sexually liberal attitudes but living with her forces Novelette to face up to the fact that she’s never really had to stand on her own two feet. Over time, Novelette learns to believe in herself and her abilities, take responsibility for her life and her future and take a chance on love with the woman she desires.
